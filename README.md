# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

 The purpose of this webpage is to serve as an aid in the coding bootcamp. I built this webpage to hold my notes for the bootcamp course. This allows for me to have a place to retain the knowledge gained from the course as well as to practice said  knowledge. This solves the problem of having to use multiple sources for basic inforation for future project, instead allowing for a single repository of the needed information. I have learned from this project the basic skills needed to start the coding bootcamp and the means to succeed with future projects.
